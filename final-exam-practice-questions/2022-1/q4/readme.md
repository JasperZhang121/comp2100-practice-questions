## Q4 - Open Question (25 marks)

A junior software engineer designs and implements a simple calculator that is required to perform the following basic arithmetic operations:

* Add
* Subtract
* Multiply
* Divide
* Exponentiate

Each operation takes 2 integers as inputs and outputs the result. The calculator users are allowed to specify the operations and the inputs via a `Client` class.

Part 1) However, there are a number of deficiencies and loopholes in the current code. Could you point them out and improve them?

Part 2) What are your suggestions for the design of the code for the purpose of a better extensibility if new arithmetic operations are needed to be incorporated into the code in future? You can provide concrete examples. What kinds of new features can be incorporated? How your current code needs to be adapted for the new features?

Part 3) Is there any room for improvement on the code from the perspective of Licensing and Intellectual Property?

Exploit all the knowledge you have learned from this course to give answers to the above questions. You are encouraged to answer the questions from any perspectives that you think are appropriate, e.g. efficiency, testability, extensibility, maintainability, correctness, intellectual property, etc. You are encouraged to point out as many deficiencies as possible.

Please be concise (objective and specific). Try to provide a list of bullet points summarising your thoughts with concise explanations for each bullet point. Long paragraphs may not help you get more marks.

Here is some examples of your answers:

1. There is a deficiency in the design of the calculator ... because it is not efficient to ....

I will apply a design pattern to the classes ...


2. There is a calculation error in the XXX() method of the class XXX.

I will ...


3. ...
