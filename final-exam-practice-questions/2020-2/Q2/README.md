##### Q2 - Software Testing [30 marks]
Implement JUnit test cases for ALL METHODS (except the constructor methods) of the classes `Person` and `PersonRepository` that is Branch Complete [5 marks]. For the `calcInsurancePrice()` method of the `Person` class [15 marks] and the `save()` method of the `PersonRepository` class [10 marks], write the MINIMUM number of JUnit test cases that is Branch Complete. Write your test cases in the `PersonTest.java` and `PersonRepositoryTest.java` files, respectively.

Note that:  
Each execution of an assertion counts as a single test case, therefore loops that execute the same assertion multiple times count as multiple tests.  
`&&` and `||` operators introduce their own branches.  
All test cases must pass the JUnit test to get full marks.  
You must use JUnit4 to write your test cases.  
Each test file will be run separately. This means that the test cases created in the `PersonRepositoryTest` class will only be used to test the` PersonRepository` class, and the test cases created in the `PersonTest` class will only be used to test the `Person` class.  

Upload the files: `PersonTest.java` and `PersonRepositoryTest.java` to Wattle for marking.
