# ðŸ˜„ Happy to See the Peak Views on June 4th!
![traffic-pic](https://github.com/JasperZhang121/comp2100-practice-questions/assets/111576857/e1cda01c-12d9-4635-9712-ff3196a11857)

It brings me immense joy to witness the peak views on June 4th for this repository! It was such a fun experience to see the interest surge right before the final exam.

Curiously enough, after June 5th, there haven't been any views. It seems everyone was busy conquering their exams or taking a well-deserved break!

Speaking of exams, I couldn't help but check this year's final date, and guess what? It's on June 5th! What a coincidence! ðŸ˜„

I hope my comp2100 practice questions and solutions brought you a mix of learning and enjoyment. Wishing everyone success and a fantastic journey in their studies!

Feel free to modify and adapt the message further to reflect your personal style and tone. The revised version highlights your happiness, the timing of the peak views, and adds a touch of amusement with the exam date coincidence.
